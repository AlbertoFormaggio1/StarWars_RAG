<h1>Darth Maul</h1><p>
</p><p>Darth Maul, later known simply as Maul, is a character in the Star Wars franchise. He first appeared in the 1999 film Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace (portrayed by Ray Park and voiced by Peter Serafinowicz) as a powerful Sith Lord and Darth Sidious' first apprentice. Though seemingly killed by Obi-Wan Kenobi at the end of the film, Darth Maul returned in the 2008 animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars (voiced by Sam Witwer). Star Wars creator George Lucas had intended for the resurrected Maul to serve as the main antagonist of the sequel film trilogy, but these plans were abandoned when Disney acquired Lucasfilm in 2012. The character nonetheless reappeared in the 2014 animated series Star Wars Rebels and the 2018 film Solo: A Star Wars Story, voiced again by Witwer; Park physically reprised the role in Solo. Since his initial defeat in The Phantom Menace, Maul has become an independent criminal mastermind and endured as Obi-Wan's archenemy.
Darth Maul is a Zabrak Sith Warrior from Dathomir who is abducted by Sidious as a child and trained in the ways of the dark side of the Force. He mortally wounds Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn during the Battle of Naboo before being bisected by Qui-Gon's apprentice, Obi-Wan. Fueled by his hatred, Maul survives and is driven insane over a decade of isolation until his brother, Savage Opress, finds him during the Clone Wars. Once his mind and body are restored with magick and cybernetics by the Nightsister Mother Talzin, Maul obsessively seeks revenge against Obi-Wan. He unites various crime syndicates under his leadership, orchestrates a takeover of Mandalore and murders Obi-Wan's lover, Duchess Satine Kryze. Maul is captured by Sidious for becoming a threat, but escapes before the Republic is replaced by the Galactic Empire. He renounces his Sith title of "Darth", rebuilds his criminal organization and manipulates Ezra Bridger into helping him find Obi-Wan on Tatooine, where the two old rivals have a final confrontation that ends in Maul’s death.
In addition to the films and television series, the character has appeared in various forms of media in the Star Wars Expanded Universe, including novels, comic books and video games. Despite his limited presence in The Phantom Menace, Darth Maul has become a fan favorite in the franchise and a widely recognised villain in popular culture for his intimidating appearance and double-bladed lightsaber. His resurgence and expanded characterization in The Clone Wars further heightened his popularity within the Star Wars fandom and earned him a cult following.
