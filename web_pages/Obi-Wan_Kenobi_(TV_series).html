<h1>Obi-Wan Kenobi (miniseries)</h1><p>
Obi-Wan Kenobi is an American space opera television miniseries produced by Lucasfilm for the streaming service Disney+. It is part of the Star Wars franchise. Set ten years after the Jedi Order was purged during the events of the film Star Wars: Episode III â€“ Revenge of the Sith (2005), the series follows surviving Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi who emerges from hiding to rescue the kidnapped Princess Leia from the Galactic Empire's Inquisitors. This brings Kenobi into conflict with his former apprentice, Darth Vader.
Ewan McGregor stars as the title character, reprising his role from the Star Wars prequel trilogy. Co-stars such as Joel Edgerton, Bonnie Piesse, Jimmy Smits, Hayden Christensen (Vader), and Ian McDiarmid also reprise their prequel trilogy roles. The project originated as a spin-off film written by Hossein Amini and directed by Stephen Daldry, but it was reworked as a limited series following the commercial failure of the film Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018). McGregor was confirmed to be starring in the series in August 2019, and Deborah Chow was hired to direct all of the episodes a month later. Production was scheduled to begin in July 2020, but the series was put on hold in January 2020 because Lucasfilm was unsatisfied with the scripts. Joby Harold was hired to rewrite the series and serve as showrunner in April 2020, executive producing with Chow, McGregor, Kathleen Kennedy, and Michelle Rejwan. Additional casting took place in March 2021. Filming began by that May in Los Angeles, using StageCraft video wall technology, and wrapped by that September. Natalie Holt composed the original score, while Star Wars film composer John Williams wrote a new main theme for Kenobi that William Ross adapted for several scenes.
Obi-Wan Kenobi premiered on May 27, 2022, with its first two episodes. The other four episodes were released weekly through June 22. The series received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise directed towards McGregor's performance, the action sequences, John Williams's new main theme, the character-driven narrative, and the series' emotional weight, although the writing received some criticism. It also received multiple accolades, including winning Best Limited Event Series for Streaming and Best Guest Starring Role on Television (for Christensen) at the 47th Saturn Awards, as well as a nomination for Outstanding Limited or Anthology Series at the 75th Primetime Emmy Awards.
<title>"Part I"</title><p>

Ten years after Order 66, when most of the Jedi Order were killed, reclusive former Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi is hiding in a cave on Tatooine, under the alias "Ben." He watches over a young Luke Skywalker, the son of his former apprentice-turned-enemy Anakin Skywalker, now living with his uncle and aunt, Owen and Beru Lars, despite Owen disliking Kenobi. Kenobi has also lost his connection to the Force, cannot communicate with the Force spirit of his former deceased master, Qui-Gon Jinn, and experiences nightmares from his past. The Inquisitors, led by the Grand Inquisitor, look for a Jedi named Nari on Tatooine. Reva Sevander, Third Sister of the Inquisitors, is also obsessed with finding Kenobi, who is widely believed to be dead. In an attempt to lure him, she hires bounty hunters to kidnap Princess Leia Organa from Alderaan. Nari tries to get help from Kenobi but is rejected and later hanged in the town. Kenobi agrees to rescue Leia after her adoptive father, Bail Organa, visits his home.</p><title>"Part II"</title><p>

After tracking Leia's kidnappers to the planet Daiyu, Kenobi encounters con man Haja Estree, who pretends to be a Jedi. Haja directs Kenobi to Leia's location, where he defeats the kidnappers and rescues her. The Grand Inquisitor learns of their presence and puts the city on lockdown. Reva disobeys orders and places a new bounty on Kenobi, causing mercenaries around the city to target him and Leia. When Leia realizes they are after Kenobi, she loses trust in him and runs away. Escaping to a roof with mercenaries attempting to kill them, Leia jumps off and Kenobi saves her using the Force, regaining her trust. Haja directs them to an unguarded cargo port from which they can escape, but cannot stop Reva from following them. The Grand Inquisitor arrives to arrest Kenobi himself, but Reva stabs him with her lightsaber. As Kenobi and Leia escape, Reva reveals that Anakin, whom Kenobi believed to be dead, is still alive as Darth Vader. Elsewhere, Vader awakens in a bacta tank.</p><title>"Part III"</title><p>

From his fortress on Mustafar, Vader instructs Reva to find Kenobi, promising to promote her to Grand Inquisitor if she succeeds. Kenobi and Leia's transport lands on the mining planet Mapuzo and they proceed to the rendezvous provided by Haja. Finding no one there, they take a ride on an Imperial transport. They are discovered and Imperial troops are sent to capture them, but they receive help from an Imperial officer, Tala, who is a member of the Path, an underground network that hides dissidents and outlaws hunted by the Empire. She escorts them to a secret subterranean passageway, but before they leave, Vader and the Inquisitors arrive and begin to harm innocent bystanders to lure Kenobi to reveal himself. Kenobi sends Leia and Tala ahead while he provides a distraction. He is eventually confronted by Vader, who overpowers Kenobi and burns him. Tala provides a distraction to save Kenobi, but Leia is captured by Reva.</p><title>"Part IV"</title><p>

Having escaped Vader on Mapuzo, Kenobi and Tala arrive at a Path facility on Jabiim. Meanwhile, Leia, being held in Fortress Inquisitorius, the stronghold headquarters of the Inquisitors located on Nur, is interrogated by Reva for details on the Path. Kenobi and Tala plan to infiltrate the fortress to rescue Leia. Once inside, Kenobi discovers a trophy vault filled with the preserved corpses of Jedi who had been captured and killed, including a Youngling. They rescue Leia but Tala's cover is blown and their presence is revealed. They eventually escape with help from Path commander Roken and his guerilla troops. Vader, angered by the events, moves to kill Reva for her failure, but spares her when she reveals that a tracker was attached to Leia's companion droid, Lola, in anticipation of a rescue.</p><title>"Part V"</title><p>

Vader reflects on lightsaber training he had with Kenobi prior to the Clone Wars as he tracks the Path network to Jabiim. Vader promotes Reva to Grand Inquisitor, who leads a siege on the Path facility, deactivating its escape doors. To stall for time, Kenobi speaks with Reva and deduces that she knows Vader's true identity from witnessing his massacre at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant when she was a Youngling. She reveals she wanted to gain Vader's favor to kill him for revenge. The facility is then breached, with Tala sacrificing herself to save Kenobi. Realizing they cannot win, Kenobi surrenders and is taken to Reva. He convinces Reva to kill Vader when she delivers Kenobi. Meanwhile, Leia opens the facility doors after removing Lola's tracker, allowing the Path to escape as Vader arrives at the docking bay. Reva uses this opportunity to try to kill Vader but is quickly overpowered after a brief duel and stabbed. She is left for dead as the original Grand Inquisitor arrives to reaffirm his status. As the Path network escapes, Reva finds Bail Organa's message on Kenobi's transmitter, revealing Luke's location on Tatooine.</p><title>"Part VI"</title><p>

Reva arrives on Tatooine to find Luke, while Darth Vader and the Empire pursue the Path network. Kenobi decides to lure Vader away and confront him alone on a nearby planet, allowing the Path to safely escape. After regaining his full connection to the Force, Kenobi incapacitates Vader. Realizing Anakin has completely embraced his identity as Darth Vader, a saddened Kenobi leaves. After arriving at Luke's home, Reva is confronted by Owen and Beru. She subdues them and pursues Luke into the desert. After remembering Anakin's massacre of the Jedi Temple, she decides to return Luke to his family. Kenobi congratulates her for overcoming her trauma and liberating herself from the Dark Side. On Mustafar, a healed Vader abandons his search for Kenobi after his master, Emperor Palpatine, questions his motives and loyalty. Back on Alderaan, Leia finds new resolve in her duties as a princess. Kenobi visits the Organas and affirms that he will help them when needed. Returning to Tatooine, he resolves his conflict with Owen by agreeing to let Luke have a normal life and finally meets with Luke for the very first time. Having found inner peace, Obi-Wan is finally able to converse with the Force spirit of Qui-Gon Jinn.</p>
