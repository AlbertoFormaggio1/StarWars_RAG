<h1>Jango Fett</h1><p>
</p><p>Jango Fett is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise, created by George Lucas. He first appeared as the secondary antagonist of the 2002 film Star Wars: Episode II â€“ Attack of the Clones, played by Temuera Morrison. The character is a Mandalorian bounty hunter, regarded as the best mercenary in the galaxy of his era, and the father of Boba Fett, an unmodified clone of Jango whom he kept as payment for serving as the genetic template of the Galactic Republic's clone army and raised as his son. After Jango's death at the hands of Mace Windu, Boba follows in his father's footsteps, using his father's armor, equipment, and ship, Slave I, to become a successful bounty hunter in his own right. The animated series The Bad Batch further reveals two daughters of Jango to have been grown alongside Boba, without Jango's knowledge: Omega and Emerie Karr.
Outside of the films, the character appears in a number of canonical and non-canonical Star Wars works, such as comic books and video games, which depict him as an antihero rather than a villainous figure, and explore his past as both a bounty hunter and Mandalorian warrior. Since the release of Attack of the Clones, Jango Fett has become a popular figure within the Star Wars fanbase, gaining a cult following, with Morrison later portraying Jango's son Boba in the Disney+ series The Mandalorian and The Book of Boba Fett.
