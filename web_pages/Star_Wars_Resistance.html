<title>"The Recruit"</title><p>

Young New Republic pilot Kazuda Xiono is recruited into the Resistance by Commander Poe Dameron, who brings Kaz to the Colossus, an aircraft refueling station on the ocean planet Castilon. Kaz's mission is to get to know everyone at this haven for the galaxy's best pilots, and learn who is working with the First Order. After a misunderstanding paints Kaz as the self-declared "best pilot in the known galaxy", he must compete in a dangerous race to prove himself. Poe's associate Jarek Yaeger lends Kaz a ship in need of repairs, The Fireball, which irks mechanic Tam Ryvora. Kaz chooses young pilot Torra Doza as his opponent, soon learning that she is undefeated. Kaz runs a good race, but crashes when he pushes The Fireball too hard.</p><title>"The Triple Dark"</title><p>

While Kaz struggles to maintain his cover as a mechanic on the Colossus, Yeager's shop receives a new customer in the form of the Neimoidian Hallion Nark, who wants the repairs to his ship to be completed before the next "triple dark", a storm that causes low visibility on Castilon. Besides juggling his work as a mechanic and spy, Kaz also has to contend with the Aleena Grevel over debts accumulated during a game of holodarts. The Quarren pirate Kragan Gorr and his gang attack the Colossus during a "triple dark" storm. Kaz manages to drive away the pirates by using a comlink to beam a jammer into their communications systems. At the exposition, it is revealed that Kragan and his pirates are proxies serving the First Order, which hope to use the chaos to establish a foothold at Colossus.</p><title>"Fuel for the Fire"</title><p>

Still struggling to fit in as a mechanic at Yeager's repair shop, Kaz is befriended by the young racer Jace Rucklin and his associates. Having gained Kaz's trust after staging a rescue during a swoop bike ocean race, Rucklin convinces Kaz to let him visit Yeager's trophy room under the pretext of seeing Yeager's racer. Rucklin steals a bottle of Corellian hyperfuel for his racer. Upon learning of the theft and the volatile nature of hyperfuel, Kaz saves Rucklin's life but earns the enmity of the young racer and his friends, who swear revenge. Despite his unsatisfactory performance, Yeager gives Kaz a second chance because he views him as a good person who saved Rucklin from himself.</p><title>"The High Tower"</title><p>

Captain Doza's fuel rationing forces Kaz and the rest of Yeager's team down to Aunt Z's cafe, where Kaz meets Hype Fazon. Hype reveals that the First Order is bringing fuel to Colossus, and Kaz runs outside to watch the First Order's ship as it comes in. Hype then invites Tam, Kaz and BB-8 to visit the High Tower, and Kaz excitedly agrees, hoping to find out what the First Order is doing on the platform. Using a comm link, he is able to listen in to Major Vonreg's meeting with Doza and discovers the First Order is offering protection from the pirates in exchange for control of the station, however as he leaves Vonreg discovers Kaz's actions. After a daring chase—and an encounter with Doza's daughter—Torra, Kaz eventually ends up back at Yeager's shop, but not before Doza begins to suspect him as the spy.</p><title>"The Children from Tehar"</title><p>

Kaz damages Tam's acceleration compensator, and promises to replace it although he is short on credits. At Aunt Z's, Kaz hears about a 20,000 credit bounty on two runaway children, which could solve his money issues. Kaz runs into the children, Kel and Eila, at the market, but they escape. Neeku introduces Kaz to the platform's engineers, the "shellfolk" Chelidae, who promise to look out for Kel and Eila. Kaz is summoned by Doza, who questions him about the children. Once Kaz leaves, Doza contacts Captain Phasma of the First Order, who sends troops to retrieve the fugitives. Out of sight of the troops, two Chelidae take the children's place and jump into the water. By slowing their life signs, the two Chelidae fake the troopers into believing that the children have drowned. Kaz passes on intelligence to the Resistance about Kylo Ren and the First Order wiping out Kel and Eila's village on Tehar in the Unknown Regions.</p><title>"Signal from Sector Six"</title><p>

With the approval of Yeager, Kaz takes leave on a starfighter training exercise with Poe. During the training exercise, the two receive a distress signal from a damaged ship, which had been attacked by pirates. While searching the ship for survivors, Kaz and Poe along with their droids BB-8 and CB-23 are attacked by several Kowakian monkey-lizards and a large Kowakian ape-lizard, the cousin of the smaller creatures. The two Resistance pilots also rescue a Mirialan crew member named Synara San, whom they bring back to the Colossus with the reluctant permission of Yeager. Unknown to the others, Synara is part of Kragan Gorr's pirate gang and becomes their undercover operative on the Colossus.</p><title>"Synara's Score"</title><p>

Captain Doza hires Yeager's Team Fireball to repair the turbolaser system's tracking computer. The repairs are complicated by a rare missing military grade computer chip. With the help of Synara who has found work as a scavenger, Kaz and Tam managed to obtain the computer chip from a sunken starship. As a result, the two come to trust Synara. In secret, Synara informs Kragan Gorr that Ace Squadron is away and the Colossus' turbolaser defense systems are down. During the pirate attack, Kaz and Yeager fight with pirates while reinstalling the tracking computer. Meanwhile, Tam and BB-8 rush into the loading docks to rescue Synara. Team Fireball managed to drive the pirates away but the second raid leads Captain Doza to seek protection from the First Order.</p><title>"The Platform Classic"</title><p>

In an attempt to boost the Colossus' economy, Captain Doza invites Yeager's estranged younger brother and renowned racer Marcus Speedstar to the Platform Classic. Still bitter at Speedstar for causing the deaths of his wife and daughter during a racing accident ten years ago, Yeager refuses to speak with Speedstar. Despite the high life, Speedstar struggles with paying his debts to the Guavian Death Gang, who kidnap his mechanic Oplock. Yeager's attempt to force Speedstar to pull out of the race backfires and Yeager is compelled to participate in the Platform Classic. At the urging of both Speedstar and Kaz, Yeager decides to forgive his younger brother and allows Speedstar to win the race. After paying Speedstar's debts to the Guavians and freeing Oplock, the two brothers reconcile before parting ways.</p><title>"Secrets and Holograms"</title><p>

Tired of being cooped up inside the luxurious Doza Tower, Captain Doza's daughter Torra Doza sneaks out of the tower. She encounters Kaz and BB-8, who are seeking information on Captain Doza's connections with the First Order. In the marketplace, Torra encounters growing public dissatisfaction with her father's leadership of the Colossus. While the First Order's emissary Commander Pyre negotiates an agreement with Captain Doza, Kaz befriends Torra Doza over a flight simulator game. Kaz manages to download a copy of Captain Doza's agreement but is spotted by Rucklin, who still bears a grudge against him for the loss of his racer. Kaz manages to hide from Captain Doza and Rucklin inside a closet (although Rucklin almost finds Kaz before he is stopped by Doza), but discovers Doza's Imperial uniform, confirming that he once served the Galactic Empire. Torra helps Kaz to escape but the two narrowly avoid being incinerated in a trash incinerator. Following the misadventure, Torra grows curious about Kaz's true identity.</p><title>"Station Theta Black"</title><p>

Kaz borrows the Fireball in order to rendezvous with Poe and the Resistance. However, Tam had not finished installing the stabilizer and Kaz loses control of the ship. He is rescued by a Resistance CR90 corvette. General Organa assigns Poe and Kaz to scout a possible First Order flight path. Traveling to the coordinates, they discover Station Theta Black, a First Order asteroid mining facility. Their presence attracts the attention of Captain Phasma and Major Vonreg, who lead a contingent to destroy the station, wiping out evidence of is existence. Following a pursuit, Kaz and Poe managed to escape the doomed station. Back at base, Kaz, Poe and Leia agree that a war is looming.</p><title>"Bibo"</title><p>

While visiting the Colossus loading docks, Neeku befriends and adopts a slimy sea creature called Bibo. Neeku's new pet causes tension with the rest of Team Fireball including his employer Yeager. Bibo runs away and Neeku enlists Tam's help in finding his pet. They find Bibo in the safe hands of Kel and Eila  but Eila warns that "something" is coming for Bibo. Meanwhile, Synara takes Kaz on a salvaging expedition in an attempt to probe into his past. However, a large sea monster besieges the platform. Synara and Kaz lock down the platform while Doza deploys the Ace Squadron to fight off the sea monster. At Tam's urging, Neeku surrenders Bibo to the creature, which turns out to be Bibo's mother.</p><title>"Dangerous Business"</title><p>

As Kaz's mechanical skills improve, he secures a part-time job manning Orka and Flix's Acquisitions shop while they are away visiting family. Kaz also has to babysit the duo's pet Gorg Bitey, who has a propensity for biting. An alien customer named Teroj Kee visits the Acquisitions shop, seeking a phase connector. Teroj lures Kaz into a trap inside a cargo container and attempts to throw into the sea. After stealing the phase connector, Teroj departs aboard a freighter with First Order stormtroopers. Kaz escapes the container and sabotages the freighter by getting Bitey to damage a power box, causing it to crash into the ocean and denying Teroj and his First Order handlers access to the phase connector. Kaz, Teroj and the stormtroopers escape the freighter using escape pods.</p><title>"The Doza Dilemma"</title><p>

Under orders from Commander Pyre, Kragan and his pirate gang Warbirds embark on a plot to kidnap Captain Doza's daughter Torra in order to force Captain Doza to accept First Order protection over the Colossus. Kragan's spy Synara is tasked with helping the pirate infiltrators Drell and Valik infiltrate Doza Tower. Having grown attached to Kaz and his friends, Synara becomes disillusioned with being a pirate. Drell and Valik managed to kidnap Torra and deliver her to Kragan's barge. First Order forces led by Major Vonreg rescue Torra (betraying the pirates in the process) and return her to Captain Doza, who is under more pressure to accept First Order protection. Meanwhile, Kaz becomes suspicious of Synara while Kragan's Warbirds sever ties with the First Order.</p><title>"The First Order Occupation"</title><p>

Following the kidnapping attempt against Torra, her father Captain Doza allows First Order stormtroopers to patrol the Colossus. Yeager advises Kaz to keep a low profile. After stormtroopers visit Yeager's repairs to question Kaz about Synara, Kaz decides to help her escape the Colossus despite knowing her true identity as a pirate. Despite being pursued by stormtroopers, Kaz manages to help Synara escape in an underwater escape pod. Synara reunites with Kragan's pirate gang, but her friendship with Kaz and Tam leads her to question her loyalty to Kragan.</p><title>"The New Trooper"</title><p>

Kel and Elia seek out Kaz's aid involving a stormtrooper they knocked out. To avoid the stormtrooper being missed, Kaz takes his armor and infiltrates the First Order, learning that First Order is plotting a full-scale takeover of the Colossus. He manages to escape with a data rod from Commander Pyre's shuttle and return his armor to its owner before the stormtroopers can catch him. Upon returning to Yeager, they discover that the First Order is amassing a large fleet and intend to use the Colossus as a resupply station.</p><title>"The Core Problem"</title><p>

Kaz accompanies Poe on a mission to investigate First Order activity in the Dassal system within the Unknown Regions. Traveling there, they discover that the system's sun has vanished, several wrecked planetoids, and that the planet Najra-Va has been drilled through. Kaz and Poe encounter a First Order probe droid on an abandoned moon, whose population has been wiped out by the First Order. After escaping First Order TIE fighters, Kaz and Poe part company with BB-8 accompanying Poe on a mission to Jakku. Returning with the astromech droid CB-23, Kaz's frequent trips offworld start to draw Tam's suspicion.</p><title>"The Disappeared"</title><p>

As the First Order tightens its grip on the Colossus, racing is banned. Several outspoken Colossus residents including Ace Squadron leader Hype Fazon (who dislikes the fact that racing is no longer allowed) and Aunt Z mysteriously disappear. Kaz helps his friend Torra to investigate Hype's disappearance. Meanwhile, Yeager and Captain Doza join forces to send a message to Resistance. Kaz and Torra discover that Hype, Aunt Z and two other alien residents are being imprisoned in the West's docks. They free the prisoners and help them escape offworld to find help. Returning to Yeager's shop, Kaz and Team Fireball are arrested by Commander Pyre.</p><title>"Descent"</title><p>

With the help of the Chelidae, Kaz and his friends managed to escape Commander Pyre and flee into the Colossus' underlevels. Believing the situation to be a misunderstanding, Tam surrenders herself to the First Order. First Order Security Bureau Agent Tierny gains her trust by revealing Kaz's true identity as a Resistance spy, while deceiving her by saying that the First Order are peacekeepers. Kaz and the others reunite with Kel, Eila and the Chelidae in the engineering deck. Kaz comes up with a plan to take out the First Order's communications jammer by sinking the station. With Captain Doza's help, Kaz's plan works, but Tierny becomes suspicious upon noticing that only Doza Tower is still above water. Kaz, Yeager and CB-23 swim up to Doza Tower and disable the jammer long enough for Kaz to send a message to the Resistance. Yeager allows himself to be captured so Kaz can escape. Returning to the engineering deck, Kaz and the others receive General Organa's apologies that the Resistance is unable to aid them. Kragan and the pirates intercept Kaz's message, drawing Synara's attention.</p><title>"No Escape: Part 1"</title><p>

When Captain Doza protests Yeager's imprisonment, Pyre decides he had exhausted his usefulness and has him and the Aces arrested. 4D, Doza's droid helper, tries to help Doza but is destroyed by Pyre. Meanwhile, Kaz, Neeku, Kel and Elia capture the platform control center so Kaz and CB-23 can infiltrate the detention cells. They soon discover a hyperdrive above their heads and realize the Colossus is a starship and start preparing for liftoff. At the same time, Agent Tierny manipulates Tam's resentment towards Kaz to motivate her into joining the First Order and reveals that Yeager knew who Kaz really is all this time. This is further supported when Tam lashes out at a captured Yeager for hiding Kaz's true identity this entire time. Kaz runs into Torra, who agrees to lead him to the cells. At one point, they are caught by a First Order astromech droid, who almost gives away their location before it is stopped by CB-23. They soon eavesdrop on a group of stormtroopers viewing a transmission from General Hux, proclaiming the end of the New Republic. Kaz can only watch in horror as Starkiller Base destroys his home of Hosnian Prime and his parents along with it.</p><title>"No Escape: Part 2"</title><p>

While Kaz and Torra rescue Yeager and Doza, the First Order decides to leave the planet immediately. Neeku flushes the stormtroopers out through the submerged portions of the Colossus. Yeager and Kaz cut off Tierny, Pyre and Tam at the First Order shuttle, but are cornered by the remaining stormtroopers. They attempt to reason with Tam, but she chooses to side with the First Order, as she is upset with them for lying to her. As Neeku gets the Colossus airborne, Doza frees the Aces and send them out to defend the ship from the First Order's TIE fighters. Aunt Z and Hype Fazon return to help, along with the pirates, and they take out the TIE fighters. Yeager is nearly shot down by Major Vonreg, but Kaz shoots Vonreg down first—as a Star Destroyer shows up. Everyone retreats to the hangar, and the Colossus jumps into hyperspace to meet the Resistance on D'Qar. Neeku reveals that he failed to enter the coordinates to D'Qar before jumping, so the crew has no way of knowing where they will end up.</p><title>"Into the Unknown"</title><p>

The Colossus comes out of hyperspace in an unknown region. In the lower decks of the Colossus, Kazuda and his friends work to restore the station's artificial gravity, and have to stop the stowed-away First Order astromech droid from sending a beacon to its comrades in the Castilon system. Aboard a Star Destroyer, Tam pledges her loyalty to the First Order in the wake of Kazuda's apparent betrayal—even if it means revealing the location of the Colossus. Kazuda sends her a message, hoping to apologize, but Tam cuts the transmission short and dons her TIE pilot helmet.</p><title>"A Quick Salvage Run"</title><p>

Tam listens to Kazuda's transmission, and is overheard by Rucklin, now also a First Order cadet pilot. He forces Tam to share the communication with Agent Tierny. The Colossus arrives at D'Qar to find that the Resistance base has been destroyed, but their supply of coaxium has been depleted—making it impossible to make another jump to hyperspace. Kaz suggests salvaging some from the remains of a First Order Dreadnought, which he does with the help of the pirates. The First Order arrives and the Aces defend the away team as Neeku transfers the unstable coaxium to the Colossus, with its shields failing just before they are able to make the jump to hyperspace.</p><title>"Live Fire"</title><p>

Yeager trains the Aces, enlisting Kazuda to help based on his experience flying for the Resistance. Hype is reluctant to help Kaz or the Resistance, but Torra convinces him to help in order to defend the station. As they train over the planet's surface below, they are attacked by a manta ray-like monster which looms over Hype. The flyers cooperate to thwart the beast, and back on the Colossus, Hype warmly welcomes Kaz into the Aces. Meanwhile, Tam trains as a TIE fighter pilot and saves Rucklin after accidentally disabling his controls during an exercise; however, her actions do not please the First Order.</p><title>"Hunt on Celsor 3"</title><p>

The crew of the Colossus is running low on supplies, prompting the pirates to hunt the manta ray-like jakoosk on the planet, Celsor 3. Kaz and Torra independently join the hunt, but the beast is immune to their fire. Two of the pirates are knocked to the surface, forcing Kragan and Synara to retreat in their sail barge. Later, Kaz and Torra return to the cold planet and land in an attempt to fire on the jakoosk from below. Their plans are complicated by Torra's unruly pet Buggles joining them and the marooned pirates stealing their fighters to escape. However, Kaz is successful in taking down the jakoosk, and the Colossus retrieves them and celebrates with a feast.</p><title>"The Engineer"</title><p>

Kaz and Synara rescue a Nikto engineer named Nena, who helps repair the Colossus while befriending Neeku and expressing her hatred towards the pirates. However, they later discover that Nena is an agent working for the First Order to sabotage the Colossus and reveal its location as Pyre's Star Destroyer attacks. As Nena flees into hyperspace, Kaz and Neeku (who is upset after learning the truth about Nena) manage to undo her sabotage, allowing the Colossus to escape. Disappointed with Nena's failure, Agent Tierny orders Pyre to execute Nena should they ever meet her again.</p><title>"From Beneath"</title><p>

Short on fuel, Kaz, Torra Doza, CB-23, Flix and Orka travel to Flix's homeworld of Drahgor III, a stormy world with deep mines containing fuel. Flix receives an icy reception from his estranged cousins, particularly Flanx. In returning for helping to repair a broken drill, Flanx agrees to supply the offworlders with fuel. Their mission goes awry when the lift malfunctions. While Torra and Orka climb back to the surface, the others are attacked by a large Karnex dragon, which captures Flanx. They rescue Flanx, but are attacked by more dragons. With the help of Torra and Orka, they manage to drive the dragons away and seal the entrance to their caves. Flix reconciles with Flanx, who gives the offworlders fuel. Realizing that they were encroaching on the dragons' habitat, Flanx ends deep-core drilling.</p><title>"The Relic Raiders"</title><p>

Kaz, Torra, Freya, CB-23, Kel and Eila travel to a trading outpost on the forested planet of Ashas Ree to gather supplies. However, they find that the settlement has been abandoned due to the excavation of an ancient Sith temple. While exploring the Sith temple, Kaz is trapped in a chamber with an archaeologist named Mika Grey, who wants to prevent the First Order from getting hold of a Sith relic. Working with Kel, Eila and CB-23, they manage to escape a giant grinding machine. After Mika obtains the relic, the group discover that First Order raiders led by Raith have captured Torra and Freya. Though the First Order captures Kaz, Kel, Eila and CB-23, Mika throws the Sith relic, unleashing a powerful wave of energy that vaporizes the First Order raiders, destroying the relic but denying it to the First Order. Mika agrees to accompany Kaz and his party back to the Colossus, striking a friendship with the Force-sensitive Eila.</p><title>"Rendezvous Point"</title><p>

Captain Doza uses a signal beacon to contact his wife Resistance pilot Venise Doza for their annual reunion. However, this draws the attention of the First Order. Following a dogfight, the Colossus is forced to retreat into hyperspace. Venise arrives and is captured by Agent Tierny. While in captivity, she meets Tam and tries to convince her to leave the First Order. While Tam is still unwilling to leave due to her still being oblivious of the First Order's true nature, she comes to respect her adversary and question her commitment to the First Order. Venise escapes her cell with the help of her astromech droid Torch and escapes the First Order Star Destroyer, but not before skirmishing with stormtroopers and destroying several TIEs to distract Tierny, with Tam willingly allowing her to escape. While Torra is upset at not being able to rendezvous with her mother, she decides not to risk drawing First Order attention. To cheer her up, Kaz and the Ace pilots make her a jelly cake. Torra and Captain Doza spend family time together and reflect on Venise's contribution to the Resistance cause.</p><title>"The Voxx Vortex 5000"</title><p>

With the Colossus running low on money, Hype convinces Captain Doza to allow the Aces to race with his former employer Vranki, a Hutt who owns a hotel and casino in the Voxx Cluster, in order to win money from him. However, the unscrupulous Hutt cheats Hype in a rigged race with his racer droids, forcing Hype to work for him, and prevents the others from leaving unless they allow Hype to stay. Captain Doza is forced to send his Ace pilots to compete with Vranki's racer droids in the Voxx Vortex 5000 in an attempt to win Hype back. The Hutt uses a series of dirty tactics to beat the Ace competitors, leaving only Torra and Kaz. With the help of Neeku, who has figured out that Vranki is using algorithms, Kaz and Torra race against Vranki's racer droids. At the advice of Kaz, Doza convinces Vranki to wager 500,000 credits with the promise of getting the Colossus if he wins. But if they win, all the pilots are to be freed and they also get to keep the 500,000 credits. Though Torra loses, Kaz manages to beat Vranki's droids with Neeku's help despite being hindered by Vranki's goons. A humbled Vranki is forced to release the indentured Aces and give them the prize money, allowing them to leave. Hype refuses to work with his former employer again.</p><title>"Kaz's Curse"</title><p>

While playing a betting game with the Warbird pirates, Kaz is cursed by the Nikto pirate Leoz, who is jealous of Kaz's success. A series of accidents aboard the Colossus afflict Kaz, leading Neeku to believe that he is cursed, which Kaz refuses to believe. Kaz's problems are complicated by the Colossus traveling through an asteroid field in Guavian Death Gang space. After failing to stop a Guavian ship from reporting their presence, Kaz visits the archaeologist and spiritualist Mika Grey, who gives him a good luck charm. A Guavian fleet attacks the Colossus and demands that they pay a 1 million credit toll fee or surrender the Colossus, with the intention of turning them all over to the First Order. Rejecting their demands, Captain Doza sends the Aces into action. Despite leaving his lucky charm behind, Kaz manages to shoot down several Guavian ships and convinces the other Aces to lead the Guavians through the asteroid field. After escaping, Kaz realizes that he wasn't cursed and settles scores with the superstitious Leoz.</p><title>"Station to Station"</title><p>

Due to their familiarity with the Colossus, First Order TIE cadets Tam and Rucklin are assigned on a supply mission to the Titan, a similar refueling platform controlled by the First Order. Their visit coincides with a mission by Kaz, Neeku and CB-23 to steal a replacement trans-binary deflector for the Colossus. General Hux also attends a meeting of senior First Order officers to discuss counterinsurgency operations against the Resistance. Kaz and Neeku manage to reach the hyperdrive chamber where the deflector is stored but are trapped by a vengeful Rucklin, who alerts the First Order while showing no regards for the duo. A reluctant Tam secretly helps Kaz's team escape the hyperdrive chamber. After a brief skirmish with First Order forces and astromech droids in the hangar, Kaz's team escape on a getaway shuttle. A furious Hux orders Pyre to destroy the Colossus. Following the heist, Commander Pyre and Agent Tierny plan to use Tam (having been aware of her actions) to locate and destroy the Colossus. While leaving the Titan, Rucklin expresses his enjoyment with working for the First Order to Tam, unaware of Kaz, Neeku and CB-23's escape.

Norath invites Kaz to join the Resistance, but he decides to remain with his Colossus friends.</p><title>"The Mutiny"</title><p>

Seeking to take over the Colossus, Warbirds pirate gang’s leader Kragan Gorr buys several B2 super battle droids from Sidon Ithano, the “Crimson Corsair”. Unfortunately, the super battle droids are not in good condition to function. With tensions between Captain Doza and the pirates growing, Doza and Yeager task Neeku with spying on the Warbirds. Kragan convinces Neeku to help repair the super battle droids. Synara, who has befriended the locals, senses that Kragan is up to something and confides with Kaz. With the super battle droids ready, Kragan imprisons Neeku, Kaz and Synara and launches a mutiny against Captain Doza, overwhelming the defenders. However, Neeku has reprogrammed a B1 battle droid (who frees the trio) as a commander, who takes control of the super battle droids and disarms the pirates. The Warbirds are exiled from the Colossus (with Doza threatening to execute them should they ever return and try to take revenge), except Synara.</p><title>"The New World"</title><p>

The Colossus travels to the uncharted ocean world of Aeos Prime, hoping to find a safe haven. Kaz goes on a scouting expedition with former Imperial pilot Griff Halloran and their droids CB-23 and R5-G9. Kaz discovers a ruined village, a First Order TIE fighter pilot's helmet, and an abandoned rebel base. He and the others are captured by the native Aeosians, blue-skinned humanoids who ride on winged beasts called Krakavora. Believing the newcomers to be hostile, the Queen orders her forces to attack the Colossus and to execute Kaz and his group. Aeosian warriors attack the Colossus, destroying B1 and several super battle droids. Kaz manages to convince the Queen of their peaceful intentions by healing a wounded Aeosian. The Queen calls for a halt to hostilities. After meeting with Captain Doza, she allows the Colossus to seek sanctuary on her homeworld.</p><title>"No Place Safe"</title><p>

While the Colossus residents settle into their new home and mingle with the Aeosian natives, Kaz decides to return to the Resistance and makes arrangements with Norath to rendezvous near the planet Batuu, although Torra and Neeku aren't happy to learn that Kaz is leaving. Meanwhile, Commander Pyre dispatches several probe droids to search for the Colossus. Kaz encounters one of these probe droids while departing Aeos Prime aboard the Fireball. Kaz manages to destroy the probe droid, but the Fireball suffers extensive damage. CB-23 manages to repair the ship, allowing Kaz to return and warn the Colossus and Aeosians that the First Order is coming. Pyre's Star Destroyer arrives and dispatches several TIE fighters and bombers. During the ensuing dogfight, TIE cadets Tam and Rucklin see action against the Aces and their Aeosian allies, who manage to destroy several fighters and a bomber. Flying Yeager's racer, Kaz attempts to take out the Star Destroyer's bridge with a missile, but is thwarted by Tam. After reaching space, the Colossus manages to flee into hyperspace with the Aces. Yeager and a reluctant Kaz believe that Tam has chosen the First Order and is no longer their friend. Tam is promoted by Agent Tierny to Second Squadron Commander for her role in saving the Star Destroyer.</p><title>"Rebuilding the Resistance"</title><p>

Resistance Commander Venisa Doza reunites with her family on the Colossus. With the approval of her husband Captain Doza, she recruits her daughter Torra, Kaz and Hype for a mission to evacuate several Resistance recruits on Dantooine. The Aces join Venisa's Jade Squadron, which includes Norath Kev and Kaz's New Republic comrade Hugh Sion. Jade Squadron and the Aces wipe out a TIE patrol, but draw the attention of Commander Pyre and Agent Tierny, who dispatch First Order forces, including a conflicted Tam and a bloodthirsty Rucklin to intercept the rendezvous. Jade Squadron manages to rendezvous with the shuttles, but are attacked by First Order TIE fighters. Despite shooting down many TIEs, including Lieutenant Galek's, Rucklin manages to shoot down one of the shuttles. Tam hesitantly tries to shoot Kaz's ship, but is thwarted by Sion, although she survives. Jade Squadron and the two remaining shuttles manage to escape to the Colossus. Kaz, Torra and Hype are distraught by the loss of the shuttle, but Venisa tells them not to give up on hope. Captain Doza allows the Resistance recruits to stay, committing the station to the Resistance. Tam is promoted to Squadron Leader by Tierny, but earns the enmity of a jealous Rucklin, who believes that position should belong to him. Tam, on the other hand, begins to have doubts over her decision of joining the First Order.</p><title>"The Escape"</title><p>

After the First Order bomb a village on Aeos Prime as punishment for the residents aiding the Colossus, Tam decides to defect from the First Order and return to the Colossus. She arranges to meet with Kaz, Yeager and CB-23 on Castilon under the guise of a training flight. Tam is forced to knock out Rucklin and shoot down the other TIE fighters when they attack Kaz and Yeager's stolen First Order shuttle. After a brief reunion, Tam and her friends attempt to return to the Colossus, but are trapped in Commander Pyre's Star Destroyer's tractor beam. Tired of their continued failures, Supreme Leader Kylo Ren has ordered Pyre and Tierny to destroy the Colossus. Tam and Rucklin are captured while Kaz, Yeager and CB-23 manage to escape. In an attempt to save his own life and prove his loyalty, Rucklin reveals that the Colossus is in the Barabesh system but Pyre and Tierny are unmoved. Kaz and Yeager rescue Tam, who knocks out Rucklin. Working with CB-23, Kaz, Tam and Yeager send a transmission to the Colossus warning them to flee. The humans are subsequently captured, but CB manages to escape. The Colossus residents decide to help Kaz, Yeager and Tam and prepare to confront Pyre's Star Destroyer. During the ensuing battle, the Ace and Jade Squadrons attack the Star Destroyer's engines while CB-23 manages to disable the Star Destroyer's shield generator. Following a fight with Pyre, Kaz and his friends escape the stricken Star Destroyer. Tierny is Force-choked to her death by a displeased Ren as the Star Destroyer explodes, killing Pyre, Rucklin, presumably Lin Gaava, and everyone else on board. Tam is welcomed back by Yeager, Kaz, the Dozas, Aces and Jade Squadron at Aunt Z's Tavern.</p>
