<h1>Saw Gerrera</h1><p>
</p><p>Saw Gerrera is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise. He was originally introduced as a minor character in the animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars, where he was voiced by Andrew Kishino. He was subsequently played by Forest Whitaker in the film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, who went on to voice the character in the animated series Star Wars Rebels and the video game Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, and reprises the role in live-action in the television series Andor. Saw also appears in The Clone Wars spin-off Star Wars: The Bad Batch, with Kishino reprising his role.
In The Clone Wars, he is the brother of the leader of the Onderon rebels, Steela Gerrera, with whom he helps free Onderon from the Confederacy of Independent Systems, and is mentored in military combat by Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Padawan Ahsoka Tano, as well as clone trooper Captain Rex. In Rogue One, Saw is the foster parent and mentor in military combat of Jyn Erso, as well as the leader of the Partisans, an anarchist rebel cell unaffiliated with the Rebel Alliance due to Saw's violent military tactics, whose missions are explored in some episodes of Rebels and other Star Wars media.
