<h1>Palpatine</h1><p>
</p><p>Sheev Palpatine is a character in the Star Wars franchise created by George Lucas. He first appeared in the 1980 film The Empire Strikes Back as The Emperor. He is also known by his Sith name, Darth Sidious, which was first used in the novelization of The Phantom Menace (1999). Palpatine is the overarching antagonist of the three film trilogies in the Skywalker Saga. In the original trilogy, he is the Emperor of the Galactic Empire and the mentor of Darth Vader, formerly known as Anakin Skywalker. The prequel trilogy chronicles his rise from senator to emperor. He orchestrates the invasion of his home planet Naboo in a plot to become Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic, then masterminds the Clone Wars to turn the Republic into the Empire. He destroys the Jedi Order and manipulates Anakin into becoming his apprentice. In The Rise of Skywalker (2019), the final film in the sequel trilogy, a resurrected Palpatine reveals that he is the grandfather of the primary protagonist Rey, and that he created Snoke to lead the First Order. Palpatine is portrayed by Ian McDiarmid in all five Skywalker Saga films in which he physically appears.
Palpatine's story was inspired by real-world examples of democratic backsliding during the rise and rule of dictators such as Julius Caesar, Napoleon Bonaparte, and Adolf Hitler. Since the release of the original trilogy, Palpatine has become a widely recognized symbol of evil in popular culture. Since the prequel trilogy, the character has been a symbol of sinister deception and the subversion of democracy. In addition to the films, Palpatine appears in various Star Wars media, including Clone Wars (2003–2005), The Clone Wars (2008–14, 2020), Rebels (2014–2018), The Bad Batch (2021–2024), Obi-Wan Kenobi (2022) and Tales of the Jedi (2022–), all of which take place before the original trilogy.
