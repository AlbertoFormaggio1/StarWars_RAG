<h1>Ren (Star Wars)</h1><p>Ren is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise. Created by writer Charles Soule and artist Will Sliney, he first appeared in Marvel Comics' 2019â€“2020 Star Wars: The Rise of Kylo Ren comic book series. Ren became a breakout character, appearing in 2021 in the comic series Star Wars: War of the Bounty Hunters and Star Wars: Crimson Reign, and the Disney+ Halloween special Lego Star Wars: Terrifying Tales, voiced by Christian Slater. He is the masked, bodily-scarred master of the "shadow"-wielding Knights of Ren preceding Kylo Ren, allied with Qi'ra and Crimson Dawn during the reign of the Galactic Empire.
Slater's performance as Ren received positive critical reception, leading to interest in him reprising his role in live-action media on Disney+.
