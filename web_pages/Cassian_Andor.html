<h1>Cassian Andor</h1><p>
</p><p>Cassian Jeron Andor, born Kassa, is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise, primarily portrayed by actor Diego Luna. Introduced in the feature film Rogue One (2016) as a co-lead, he is the protagonist of the ongoing prequel television series Andor (2022â€“present).
He begins his life as an orphan on the abandoned mining planet Kenari. After being adopted and taken from his home by scavengers, he grows up on the industrial planet Ferrix. As a young man, he smuggles stolen Imperial ship components before joining the Rebel Alliance. Rogue One depicts Andor as a pilot and intelligence officer for the Rebel Alliance who leads a rebel unit called Rogue One in stealing plans for the Death Star, setting the events of the original Star Wars film in motion.
The character has received a mixed response from critics, with praise for Luna's performance but some criticism for the quality of the narrative guiding the character. As the first Mexican lead actor and one of the first Latino leads in a Star Wars film, his introduction in Rogue One was considered to be a milestone for Latino representation.
