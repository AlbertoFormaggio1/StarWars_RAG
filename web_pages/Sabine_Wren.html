<h1>Sabine Wren</h1><p>Sabine Wren is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise, voiced by Tiya Sircar in the animated series Star Wars Rebels (2014–2018) and Forces of Destiny (2017–2018), and portrayed by Natasha Liu Bordizzo in the live-action miniseries Ahsoka (2023).
In Star Wars Rebels, Sabine is introduced as a Mandalorian graffiti artist and bounty hunter who left the Empire for the Rebel Alliance after a weapon she developed for them was used against her people; as a rebel, she joins the crew of the Ghost, recruiting Wedge Antilles to their cause, and on stealing the Darksaber from Maul, is trained in lightsaber combat by Kanan Jarrus, in spite of an inability to use the Force, eventually giving the Darksaber to Bo-Katan Kryze, and moving to Lothal after Ezra Bridger sacrifices himself to banish himself and Grand Admiral Thrawn to another galaxy. Between the events of Rebels and Ahsoka, Sabine becomes the Jedi Padawan of Ahsoka Tano offscreen, studying Jedi practices in a failed attempt to learn how to wield the Force herself, before leaving Ahsoka after her family is killed during the genocidal Purge of Mandalore, a conflict Ahsoka had prevented Sabine from participating in. In Ahsoka, Sabine reunites with Ahsoka to investigate rumors of Thrawn's and Ezra' survival; after Ahsoka is apparently killed by former Jedi Baylan Skoll, Sabine joins him in tracking down Thrawn and Ezra, ensuring both return to the galaxy, while Sabine herself, a still-alive Ahsoka, Baylan, and his own apprentice Shin Hati are all left stranded in the other galaxy.
The character has received a generally positive critical reception, for both Sircar's vocal performance and Liu Bordizzo's physical portrayal.
