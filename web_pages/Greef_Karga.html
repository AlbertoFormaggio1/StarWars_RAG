<h1>Greef Karga</h1><p>
</p><p>High Magistrate Greef Karga is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise who appears in the Disney+ television series The Mandalorian. A former leader of the Bounty Hunters' Guild, he provides the show's title character with the bounty that leads him to meet Grogu, an alien infant also known as "The Child" and “Baby Yoda” by fans. Greef serves as both an ally and adversary to the Mandalorian at different points in the first season, and returns as an ally in the second and third seasons.
Greef Karga was created by Jon Favreau, the creator and showrunner of The Mandalorian. The character was originally planned only to appear in a handful of episodes, but Favreau and the writers liked the character so much that the role was expanded. Greef is portrayed by Carl Weathers, whom Favreau knew through the Directors Guild of America. Weathers accepted the part under the condition that he could direct future episodes of The Mandalorian; Weathers directed the episodes "Chapter 12: The Siege", which was Greef's only appearance in the show's second season, and the season three episode "Chapter 20: The Foundling".
Elements of the character's background have deliberately been kept mysterious, though it was revealed in the first-season finale that he was previously a disgraced government official, and Weathers said his backstory would be further developed in the second season. Weathers performed his stunts for The Mandalorian. He has described the role as "one of the greatest things that's happened in all of the years that I've been in entertainment". Greef has received generally positive feedback from fans and reviewers. For his performance in the second season, Weathers was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series.
