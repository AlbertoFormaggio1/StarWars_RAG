<h1>Rogue One (soundtrack)</h1><p>
</p><p>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) is the soundtrack album to the 2016 film Rogue One directed by Gareth Edwards, which is the first instalment in the Star Wars anthology series. Originally, Alexandre Desplat was hired for the film score but was replaced by Michael Giacchino during the film's post-production. Giacchino scored the film within a span of the month, despite the tight schedule, and had incorporated John Williams' themes from previous Star Wars films into the score, having minor elements, while most of the themes were newly composed. The soundtrack was released by Walt Disney Records on December 16, 2016, coinciding with the film's theatrical release.
The score received a positive response from critics, appreciating Giacchino's tunes as well as the incorporation of minimal cues from Williams' themes. It peaked at number 45 and 17, on the Billboard 200 and soundtracks chart in US, as well as in number 3 on the soundtracks chart from UK's Official Charts Company. An expanded edition, consisting of un-edited and additional demos composed, was released on February 11, 2022, as was a 4-LP disc marketed by Mondo, was published in March 2022.
