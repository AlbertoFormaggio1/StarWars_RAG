<h1>Ahsoka (TV series)</h1><p>
Ahsoka, also known as Star Wars: Ahsoka, is an American space fantasy television series created by Dave Filoni for the streaming service Disney+. It is part of the Star Wars franchise and a spin-off from The Mandalorian, taking place in the same timeframe as that series and its other interconnected spin-offs after the events of the film Return of the Jedi (1983). Ahsoka follows former Jedi apprentice Ahsoka Tano and her allies as they fight the remnants of the Galactic Empire during the time of the fledgling New Republic.
Rosario Dawson stars as the title character, reprising her role from The Mandalorian. Natasha Liu Bordizzo, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Ray Stevenson, Ivanna Sakhno, Diana Lee Inosanto, David Tennant, Eman Esfandi, Evan Whitten, Genevieve O'Reilly, Hayden Christensen, Ariana Greenblatt, Lars Mikkelsen, and Anthony Daniels also star. Ahsoka Tano was co-created by Filoni for the animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars. Dawson was cast to bring her into live-action for the second season of The Mandalorian, and a spin-off series with Dawson reprising her role and Filoni set as showrunner was announced by Lucasfilm in December 2020. It serves as a continuation of the animated series Star Wars Rebels. In addition to Filoni, Jon Favreau, Kathleen Kennedy, and Colin Wilson returned from The Mandalorian as executive producers and were joined by Carrie Beck.
Ahsoka premiered on August 22, 2023, with the first two episodes of the first season. The other six episodes were released through October 3. The season received high viewership, generally positive reviews from critics, and several accolades. In January 2024, Lucasfilm confirmed that Filoni was developing a second season.
<title>"Part One: Master and Apprentice"</title><p>

Baylan Skoll, a fallen Jedi, and his apprentice Shin Hati assault a New Republic cruiser to free Morgan Elsbeth. Morgan informs them that former Jedi Ahsoka Tano, who apprehended and interrogated Morgan, is searching for a star map that will lead to Thrawn. The last remaining grand admiral of the fallen Galactic Empire, Thrawn has been missing for years since he and rebel hero Ezra Bridger were taken to an unknown location by a pod of purrgil (space whales). Ahsoka fears that Thrawn could return and help rebuild the Empire, but is also hopeful that Ezra can be found alive. She and the ancient Jedi-training droid Huyang obtain the star map based on information from Morgan, but are unable to unlock it. New Republic general Hera Syndulla informs Ahsoka of Morgan's escape and suggests she get help unlocking the map from Sabine Wren, Ahsoka's former Padawan learner; Hera and Sabine were both close with Ezra before his disappearance. Ahsoka reluctantly visits Sabine, who she has not seen in years, on Lothal. After Sabine unlocks the map, Shin steals it and stabs Sabine during a lightsaber duel.</p><title>"Part Two: Toil and Trouble"</title><p>

Baylan and Shin take the map to the planet Seatos. Morgan explains that Thrawn is trapped in another galaxy and the map shows the path to get there, starting from Seatos. While recovering from Shin's attack, Sabine tells Ahsoka about the map but does not know which planet the path to the other galaxy starts on. Ahsoka defeats an assassin droid that Shin left behind on Lothal and Sabine traces its origins to Morgan's factories on Corellia. Ahsoka and Hera travel to the Corellian shipyards where they discover a massive hyperdrive being built by workers loyal to the Empire. As a transport takes off with the hyperdrive, Hera chases after it while Ahsoka duels Marrok, a former Jedi-hunting Imperial Inquisitor who is working with Baylan and Shin. Marrok and the transport escape, but not before Hera's astromech droid Chopper attaches a tracking device to the transport. Ahsoka and Hera arrest the shipyard workers. After a discussion with Huyang, Sabine decides that she wants to accompany Ahsoka and become her Padawan again. Ahsoka gets Sabine from Lothal and they follow the tracking device to Seatos.</p><title>"Part Three: Time to Fly"</title><p>

Sabine restarts her lightsaber training under Ahsoka and Huyang's guidance, but struggles with her inability to use the Force like other Jedi. Hera meets with New Republic chancellor Mon Mothma and several senators and asks them to send additional forces to Seatos. Her request is denied when Senator Hamato Xiono, who does not believe Thrawn and Ezra are alive, accuses Hera of using the threat of Thrawn's return to re-direct resources to a futile search for Ezra. Ahsoka, Sabine, and Huyang arrive at Seatos and discover the Eye of Sion, Morgan's large starship which the hyperdrive is being installed in. Shin and Marrok attack with a squadron of fighters, during which Ahsoka attempts to continue Sabine's lessons. Forced to land on the planet below, they pass through a pod of purrgil, evade the fighters, and hide in a forest. Based on a scan of the Eye of Sion, Huyang determines that the ship can make an unusually fast and long hyperspace jump which would allow Morgan to reach the other galaxy, something that migrating purrgil can do naturally. Baylan sends Shin, Marrok, and assassin droids to find them.</p><title>"Part Four: Fallen Jedi"</title><p>

Ahsoka, Sabine, and Huyang dispatch Baylan's droids. Fearing that Morgan and Baylan will soon have what they need to jump to the other galaxy, Ahsoka and Sabine head towards Baylan's location. Huyang asks them to stay together, and Ahsoka warns Sabine that they may need to give up the chance to find Ezra if it means preventing Thrawn's return. Confronted by Shin and Marrok, Ahsoka kills Marrok while Sabine fights Shin and encourages Ahsoka to go on alone. Ahsoka engages Baylan and retrieves the map, but drops it when it burns her hand. Shin flees when Sabine gets the upperhand, and Sabine arrives to see Baylan send Ahsoka plummeting into the ocean. Sabine threatens to destroy the map, but hands it over when Baylan promises to reunite her with Ezra. The map's details are uploaded to the Eye of Sion and then Baylan destroys the map. They jump to hyperspace as Hera arrives, against orders, with a squadron of New Republic fighters. Ahsoka awakens in the "World Between Worlds", a mystical plane that connects different points of time, and sees her former master Anakin Skywalker.</p><title>"Part Five: Shadow Warrior"</title><p>

Anakin tells Ahsoka that she has a chance to survive and he has come to finish her training. He asks her to choose to live, and attacks her. On Seatos, Hera and Huyang search for Ahsoka and Sabine. Hera's son Jacen, who has a connection to the Force like his father Kanan Jarrus, hears the sounds of Ahsoka and Anakin fighting and directs the search party. Ahsoka relives fragments of her youth during the Clone Wars and expresses concerns about her legacy as a soldier and as the student of Anakin, who fell to the dark side and became the Sith lord Darth Vader before being redeemed with his death. As Anakin continues to fight her, Ahsoka comes to terms with these issues and chooses to live on. Anakin disappears and the others find Ahsoka in the ocean. The next day she wakes up with a new outlook on life and uses the Force to determine that Sabine went with Baylan to the new galaxy. New Republic forces arrive to take Hera and Ahsoka into custody. Before they can, Ahsoka and Huyang enter the mouth of a purrgil so the pod can take them to the new galaxy. Hera and Jacen remain behind.</p><title>"Part Six: Far, Far Away"</title><p>

The Eye of Sion arrives at Peridea, the ancient homeworld of Morgan's people—the Nightsister witches—who were the first to harness the purrgil and travel between galaxies. Morgan, Baylan, Shin, and Sabine meet the Great Mothers, three Nightsisters still living on Peridea who are allies of Thrawn and who used their Force magic to call Morgan to them. Baylan reveals to Shin that he is searching for a great power on Peridea that he learned about in Jedi folktales. He hopes to use this to end the cycle of war and destruction between the light and dark sides of the Force, as seen with the fall of the Jedi and rise of the Empire. Thrawn arrives aboard his Star Destroyer, the Chimaera, and honors Baylan's promise by providing Sabine with provisions and a mount to search for Ezra. After she leaves, Thrawn has Baylan and Shin follow her so they can kill both her and Ezra once the latter is found. Surviving an ambush by bandits, Sabine encounters a local tribe, the Noti, and goes to their village where she reunites with Ezra. The Great Mothers sense Ahsoka's imminent arrival and Thrawn prepares his defences.</p><title>"Part Seven: Dreams and Madness"</title><p>

At a disciplinary hearing on Coruscant, Senator Xiono requests that Hera be court-martialed for disobeying orders. Senator Leia Organa, an ally to Hera and Ahsoka, sends her protocol droid C-3PO with fake evidence that Hera's actions were a miscommunication; the court absolves Hera. She and Mothma discuss the threat of Thrawn's possible return. Sabine catches Ezra up with what he has missed since disapearing. When the purrgil arrive at Peridea, they enter a minefield left by Thrawn. Ahsoka and Huyang exit their purrgil's mouth before it flees, and hide in a debris field until Ahsoka locates Sabine through the Force. Ezra, Sabine, and the Noti are attacked by Shin, the bandits, and Thrawn's night troopers. Sabine offers Ezra's old lightsaber to him, but he tells her to keep it and fights with the Force instead. Ahsoka confronts Baylan, but he leaves to pursue his own agenda. Realizing that Baylan is no longer fighting for him, Thrawn withdraws his troops after Ahsoka arrives. Shin is left behind and flees after spurning an invitation from Ahsoka to join them. Ahsoka reunites with Sabine and Ezra.</p><title>"Part Eight: The Jedi, the Witch, and the Warlord"</title><p>

The Chimaera is loaded with a mysterious cargo and docks with the Eye of Sion. Ezra constructs a new lightsaber using spare parts from the saber of Kanan, his master. Huyang tells Ezra that Ahsoka originally stopped training Sabine out of fear for her potential after Sabine's family were killed during the purge of Mandalore. Ahsoka now says she is committed to Sabine. Ahsoka, Sabine, and Ezra are attacked by Thrawn's night troopers and Morgan. The Great Mothers use magic to resurrect the troopers each time they are killed. While Ahsoka duels Morgan, Sabine and Ezra reach the Chimaera as it departs. Sabine uses the Force for the first time to save herself, and then uses it again to help Ezra onto the Chimaera; she stays behind to help Ahsoka, who kills Morgan. Thrawn and the Great Mothers arrive in the other galaxy at the Nightsister planet Dathomir. Ezra sneaks away and reunites with Hera. On Peridea, Shin joins the bandits; Baylan discovers statues of the Mortis gods that point the way for his journey; and Ahsoka, Sabine, and Huyang settle in with the Noti while Anakin's spirit watches over them.</p>
