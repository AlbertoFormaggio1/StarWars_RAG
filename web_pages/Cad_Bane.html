His fast draw, cunning wits and unscrupulous willingness to take any job for the right price earn him a reputation as one of the best bounty hunters in the galaxy. Often employed by other antagonists, Bane comes into conflict with the Jedi of the Galactic Republic numerous times during the Clone Wars. Through the reign of the Galactic Empire to the era of the New Republic, Bane retains his notoriety and continues to provide his services to the highest bidder, causing him to clash with Clone Force 99, Fennec Shand, Cobb Vanth, and even his former apprentice, Boba Fett.
The character has become a fan favorite villain since his introduction and is considered one of the most popular bounty hunters in the franchise alongside the likes of Boba and Jango Fett. In addition to the television series, Cad Bane has also been featured in various Star Wars comic books and video games.
