<h1>Star Wars: The Bad Batch</h1><p>
Star Wars: The Bad Batch is an American animated television series created by Dave Filoni for the streaming service Disney+. It is part of the Star Wars franchise and a spin-off from Star Wars: The Clone Wars, continuing from the end of that series to depict the aftermath of Order 66 and the end of the Clone Wars. The Bad Batch follows a unique squad of clone troopers with genetic mutations who resist Order 66 and go on the run in the early days of the Galactic Empire. They are joined by Omega, a young female clone.
Dee Bradley Baker voices the Bad Batch, as well as most of the other clones in the series, as he did in The Clone Wars. Michelle Ang voices Omega. The series was announced in July 2020, after the final season of The Clone Wars introduced the Bad Batch based on an idea from Star Wars creator George Lucas. The Bad Batch was produced by Lucasfilm Animation, with Jennifer Corbett as head writer and Brad Rau as supervising director; Filoni, Corbett, and Rau served as executive producers with Athena Yvette Portillo.
The first season premiered on May 4, 2021, and ran for 16 episodes until August 13. A 16-episode second season was released from January 4 to March 29, 2023, and a 15-episode third and final season was released from February 21 to May 1, 2024. The series has received positive reviews from critics, particularly for its animation and voice acting.

Clone Force 99, also known as "The Bad Batch", includes defective clone troopers Hunter, Tech, Crosshair, and Wrecker plus cyborg clone Echo. During the Clone Wars, the Bad Batch assists Jedi Master Depa Billaba and her Padawan learner Caleb Dume on Kaller. Order 66 is issued, triggering programming in the regular clones that makes them kill Billaba. The Bad Batch receives the order too, but only Crosshair feels compelled to obey it and Hunter lets Dume escape. Returning to the clone facilities on Kamino, the Bad Batch learns that the war is over and an Empire has replaced the Galactic Republic. They meet a young girl, Omega, who is another defective clone. Admiral Tarkin arrives to evaluate the clones and sends the Bad Batch to eliminate insurgents on Onderon. When they discover that these "insurgents" are refugees under Saw Gerrera who refuse to submit to the new Empire, the Bad Batch abandons the mission and returns for Omega. They are arrested for treason and Tarkin enhances Crosshair's programming, turning him against his squad. The rest of the Bad Batch flee with Omega.</p><title>"Cut and Run"</title><p>

The Bad Batch and Omega seek refuge on Saleucami with clone deserter Cut Lawquane, who tells them about the inhibitor chips which programmed the regular clones and Crosshair to be loyal to the Empire after Order 66. With increased military presence from the Empire, Cut plans to escape with his family but they need newly introduced chain codes to book public transport. Cut would be arrested if he tried to obtain chain codes, so Tech and Echo steal some and Omega helps deliver them to Cut and his family in time for them to board the transport. Hunter wants Omega to go with Cut so she can have a family, but she decides to stay with the Bad Batch.</p><title>"Replacements"</title><p>

The Bad Batch's ship, the Marauder, is damaged on Saleucami. They are stranded on a moon and an Ordo Moon Dragon steals the part they need to repair the ship. Hunter and Omega set out to retrieve it. When Hunter is incapacitated, Omega continues alone and retrieves the part without a fight. On Kamino, Tarkin and Vice Admiral Rampart put Crosshair in command of a new unit of conscripted soldiers. They are sent to Onderon to wipe out Gerrera's camp, but Gerrera is already gone. Crosshair kills a disloyal recruit, but the rest comply and are otherwise successful. Tarkin sees potential for conscripted soldiers, concerning Kaminoan prime minister Lama Su.</p><title>"Cornered"</title><p>

On their way to a proposed hiding-place on Idaflor, the Bad Batch is forced to stop on the nearest planet, Pantora, so they can gather supplies and Tech can modify their ship's signature since it now appears on the Empire's wanted list. A landing bay attendant on Pantora identifies the Bad Batch and informs Fennec Shand, a mercenary who has been hired to retrieve Omega. Hunter, Echo, and Omega search for supplies while Tech and Wrecker work on the ship. Omega is approached by Shand, which leads to Hunter chasing Shand through the city. Hunter and Omega lose Shand, and after the modifications are completed the Bad Batch departs from Pantora.</p><title>"Rampage"</title><p>

Hoping to discover who hired Shand, the Bad Batch goes to Ord Mantell where Echo knows of an informant named Cid. She offers to find out about Shand in exchange for their help: slavers have kidnapped a child named Muchi, and Cid will receive a reward from Jabba the Hutt if the Bad Batch helps her rescue the child. The Bad Batch finds and fights off the slavers, rescuing Muchi, who is a young rancor. Taking her to Cid, Muchi is then given to Jabba's right-hand man Bib Fortuna in exchange for the reward. Cid gives some of the reward to Hunter but is unable to learn who hired Shand. She offers to give the Bad Batch more mercenary work in the future.</p><title>"Decommissioned"</title><p>

Cid hires the Bad Batch to retrieve a Separatist tactical droid with battle intel before it is destroyed at a Corellian decommissioning site. They run into smuggler sisters Trace and Rafa Martez, who are also after the droid. Wrecker's inhibitor chip begins to activate after he accidentally hits his head. Tech copies the tactical droid's data before it is destroyed when he and the sisters program it to turn on the police droids that are guarding the facility, allowing them to escape. The sisters explain that they were retrieving the droid for a client who is fighting the Empire, and Hunter decides to give them the data. Later, the sisters tell their client how to find the Bad Batch.</p><title>"Battle Scars"</title><p>

After they fail to retrieve the tactical droid's data, Cid tells the Bad Batch that they will need to do a big job to pay off their debt to her. They are interrupted by the Martez sister's client, former clone captain Rex, who is alarmed to learn that the Bad Batch have yet to remove their inhibitor chips as he has. They go to Bracca, a starship graveyard planet controlled by the Scrapper Guild, and sneak onto an old Jedi cruiser to use its medical bay. Wrecker's chip forces him to attack his squad mates, but he is subdued and the chip is removed. Rex takes his leave once the extractions are completed; as they say goodbye, Hunter is seen by members of the Scrapper Guild.</p><title>"Reunion"</title><p>

The Scrapper Guild informs the Empire of the Bad Batch's location, and Crosshair is sent to kill them. Concerned that Omega will not be returned safely, Lama Su hires a second bounty hunter to retrieve the girl. The Bad Batch attempts to reach the Marauder through the Jedi cruiser's ion engine. Crosshair pins them inside and has the engine turned on, but they use explosives salvaged from the cruiser's armory to escape and Crosshair is injured by the engine's ignition. Hunter and Omega are confronted by bounty hunter Cad Bane, who shoots Hunter and kidnaps Omega. The rest of the squad catch up, carry the injured Hunter to the Marauder, and escape.</p><title>"Bounty Lost"</title><p>

While chasing after Bane, the Bad Batch learns from Tech that Omega is an unmodified clone of Jango Fett and so is the only available source of fresh cloning material for the Kaminoans. En route to an old Kaminoan cloning facility on Bora Vio for her delivery, Omega tricks Bane's droid aide Todo into releasing her and is able to signal the Bad Batch. Lama Su sends Taun We to retrieve Omega and orders Nala Se to eliminate the girl after extracting genetic samples from her. Nala Se cares for Omega and wants to keep her safe, so she sends Shand to rescue her. Shand kills Taun We and duels Bane, allowing Omega to escape and be retrieved by the Bad Batch.</p><title>"Common Ground"</title><p>

On Raxus, which was the seat of the Separatist government during the Clone Wars, the Empire institutes new curfew laws with the support of local senator Avi Singh. However, Singh speaks out against the Empire while addressing the public and is arrested. His protocol droid GS-8 hires Cid to help rescue Singh, and she sends the Bad Batch; they are reluctant to help after fighting against the Separatists in the Clone Wars. Omega is left behind due to the bounty hunters that are targeting her, and she wins Cid enough money playing dejarik to pay off the Bad Batch's debt. With the help of GS-8, the Bad Batch rescues Singh and take him to Cid for payment.</p><title>"Devil's Deal"</title><p>

When Senator Orn Free Taa announces a new Imperial refinery on Ryloth and encourages Twi'lek freedom fighters to disarm, resistance leader Cham Syndulla publicly supports the Empire. His lieutenant Gobi Glie takes Cham's daughter Hera on a secret mission to retrieve weapons from the Bad Batch, during which Hera befriends Omega. Crosshair tracks them, and the Empire arrests Glie and Hera for treason. Cham attacks the Imperial convoy to rescue them with his wife Eleni and other freedom fighters. Crosshair shoots Orn Free Taa, allowing Rampart to frame Cham for Taa's attempted assassination. Cham, Eleni, and Glie are arrested but Hera escapes.</p><title>"Rescue on Ryloth"</title><p>

Hera contacts Omega and asks the Bad Batch to help rescue her parents. Hunter does not think this is worth the risk, but Omega convinces him. Hera, Omega, Tech, and Wrecker attack the new Imperial refinery on Ryloth as a distraction while Echo and Hunter free Cham, Eleni, and the other freedom fighters. Crosshair discovers this and sets a trap for them, but clone Captain Howzer—who is loyal to Cham—warns the escapees of the trap and then confronts his fellow soldiers. Howzer is arrested while the Bad Batch and freedom fighters escape. Rampart realizes that he has underestimated the Bad Batch and gives Crosshair permission to hunt them down.</p><title>"Infested"</title><p>

The Bad Batch returns from a mission to find Cid's parlor under the ownership of crime boss Roland Durand. They find Cid outside, and she reveals a plan to take back the parlor by stealing a shipment of spice from Roland that is intended for the Pyke Syndicate. The Bad Batch and Cid enter her office via underground tunnels infested with a hive of Irlings. They retrieve the spice, but are chased by Roland's guards who awaken the hive. The group escape from the tunnels but lose the spice to the hive. They are caught by the Pykes, who take Omega hostage while the Bad Batch and Cid retrieve the spice from the hive. The Pykes then let Cid reclaim her parlor.</p><title>"War-Mantle"</title><p>

Rex contacts the Bad Batch and asks them to respond to a distress signal from clone commando Gregor on the planet Daro. At the source of the signal, they find an Imperial base where conscripted soldiers are being trained by clone commandos to replace the clone trooper army. Hunter, Tech, and Echo infiltrate the base while Omega and Wrecker stay in the ship as backup. The Bad Batch rescues Gregor, but Hunter is captured during the escape. On Kamino, Lama Su and Nala Se plan to escape after the Empire cancels their clone army contracts, but they are caught by Rampart. He says the Empire has a use for Nala Se as a scientist, but not for Lama Su.</p><title>"Return to Kamino"</title><p>

Hunter is taken to Tipoca City on Kamino, where the Empire has evacuated critical personnel and eliminated the rest. Crosshair activates Hunter's communicator to lure the rest of the Bad Batch there. Omega shows the others a hidden entrance into Nala Se's secret laboratory, where they were all created and where they find the friendly droid AZI-3. They find Hunter, who tries to convince Crosshair to have his inhibitor chip removed, but Crosshair reveals that it has already been removed and he is willingly working for the Empire. Hunter stuns Crosshair as Rampart, under the orders of Tarkin, begins destroying Tipoca City with the Bad Batch and Crosshair still inside.</p><title>"Kamino Lost"</title><p>

Rampart and the Empire depart as the wreckage of Tipoca City sinks into the ocean. Omega and AZI-3 save Crosshair when they are trapped in a flooding room. Once the wreckage of the city settles on the ocean floor, the group make their way to an access tube that leads to the Marauder, but find it damaged. Crosshair suggests AZI-3 guide them to the surface inside lab capsules, but the droid runs out of power on their way up. Omega tries to save him at the risk of drowning, until Crosshair saves them both. When they reach the Marauder, Crosshair chooses to part ways with the Bad Batch. Nala Se is brought to a secret Imperial facility at Mount Tantiss.</p><title>"Spoils of War"</title><p>

After a tip-off by her pirate friend Phee Genoa, Cid sends the Bad Batch to Serenno to steal part of Count Dooku's war chest. After some reluctance, Hunter agrees and the squad goes to the planet where they find the Empire already transporting the Count's wealth off world. While trying to steal some of the cargo, the Bad Batch is seen and a fight ensues during which Omega, Tech, and Echo are trapped inside a cargo ship preparing for lift-off. They fight their way to one of the cargo containers on the ship and escape inside it, attempting to use its own thrusters to make a safe landing. Meanwhile, Hunter and Wrecker are pursued through the ruins of a nearby city.</p><title>"Ruins of War"</title><p>

The cargo container crashes on Serenno. While making their way back to the Marauder, Omega, Tech, and Echo meet local man Romar Adell who is hiding in the woods. Talking to him, they get a first impression of what a free life might be like. Omega sneaks away to try recover some of the cargo from the container; Echo and Tech go after her, resulting in a clash with Imperial search parties. Romar helps them escape. Hunter and Wrecker fight their way out of the city and reunite with the others. Learning that the Bad Batch survived the destruction of Tipoca City, Rampart fears punishment for his failure to eliminate them and decides not to inform Tarkin of this.</p><title>"The Solitary Clone"</title><p>

Crosshair is assigned to clone commander Cody on a mission to the former Separatist planet Desix to rescue new Imperial governor Grotton, who has been taken hostage by a local resistance movement. Desix's former governor, Tawni Ames, demands that the planet remain out of Imperial jurisdiction and cites the Republic's refusal to broker peace with the Separatists during the Clone Wars. Cody argues for a peaceful resolution, but Crosshair kills Ames on Grotton's orders. Desix is brought under Imperial control. Returning to the Imperial capital Coruscant, Cody questions whether the Empire is doing good while Crosshair remains loyal. Cody deserts soon after.</p><title>"Faster"</title><p>

While Hunter and Echo are away on an assignment, Cid takes Omega, Tech, and Wrecker to a race on Safa Toma. Cid is challenged by Millegi, one of her business rivals, and his racer Jet Venim. During the next round, Millegi orders Venim to cheat and this causes Cid's cocky droid racer TAY-0 to lose. When Millegi comes to collect, Omega challenges him to another race for Cid's freedom. Just before the next event, TAY-0 is wrecked in an accident. Tech takes TAY-0's place as Cid's pilot and uses his calculative intellect to offset his lack of experience, winning the race. Millegi honors his end of the deal, but warns the clones that Cid might turn against them one day.</p><title>"Entombed"</title><p>

While searching a junkyard for useful salvage, Omega and Wrecker find an ancient compass with a set of coordinates for the uncharted Kaldar Trinary system. Believing this compass will lead them to hidden treasure, Phee and Omega persuade the Bad Batch to set out for the system. The compass leads them to the planet Skara Nal, the resting place of a legendary crystal known as the "Heart of the Mountain". They find the crystal and Phee takes it, activating a giant, ancient mech which begins destroying their surroundings. Fearing that the Marauder will be destroyed and leave them stranded, the others convince Phee to return the crystal. This destroys the mech.</p><title>"Tribe"</title><p>

The Bad Batch goes to the criminal cartel Vanguard Axis to sell chain codes that Tech has forged. While there, Omega helps Gungi, a captive Wookiee Jedi youngling, escape from the cartel. Taking Gungi back to his homeworld Kashyyyk, the Bad Batch finds the planet being ravaged by a group of Trandoshan mercenaries who work for the Empire. After winning the trust of a local Wookiee tribe, the Bad Batch learns about the respect that the Wookiees have for the giant wroshyr trees. They join the Wookiees and the indigenous wildlife to enact a plan that the Wookiees say came from the trees. Together they defeat the Imperial forces and Gungi is reunited with his people.</p><title>"The Clone Conspiracy"</title><p>

Rampart asks the Imperial Senate to authorize the replacement of the clone army with conscripted Stormtroopers. He has covered up the intentional destruction of Tipoca City, blaming it on a storm. Senator Riyo Chuchi advocates for the clones' rights and is approached by clone trooper Slip, whose friend was killed after questioning Rampart's storm story. Rampart sends an assassin to kill them. As Chuchi asks Slip to testify in front of the Senate, the assassin kills Slip and attacks Chuchi. She is rescued by Rex, who Slip had asked for help. Rex captures the assassin, who is a clone, but the assassin kills himself before he can be questioned.</p><title>"Truth and Consequences"</title><p>

Rex asks the Bad Batch for help and they travel to Coruscant. Omega accompanies Chuchi to ask for support from other senators while Rex and the Bad Batch sneak aboard Rampart's Star Destroyer, which is undergoing maintenance, to retrieve proof of the Tipoca City cover-up. In the Senate, Chuchi exposes Rampart's lie and he is arrested. However, Emperor Palpatine argues that Rampart's attack was carried out by clones and so this revelation supports the need for a new, conscripted army; the Senate approves the bill. Before the Bad Batch leaves Coruscant, Echo decides to stay with Rex to help him fight for a better future for the clones.</p><title>"The Crossing"</title><p>

Cid sends the Bad Batch to extract some ipsium mineral from a mine she recently purchased. While they are in the mine, the Marauder is stolen and they are stranded. Forced to trek towards a nearby spaceport, the Bad Batch is buried inside another mine when their ipsium is detonated by a lightning storm. Inside the new mine, Omega discovers an ipsium vein and tries to harvest it with Tech. They are separated from the others and have a talk about adapting to changes in life, such as Echo's departure, before they find another way out. They find the spaceport abandoned but manage to contact Cid, who grudgingly agrees to pick them up in a few days.</p><title>"Retrieval"</title><p>

The Marauder is taken by its thief, a young boy named Benni Baro, to gang boss Mokko at a nearby ipsium mining facility. Mokko prepares to strip the ship for parts to sell. At the spaceport, Omega devises a way to track the Marauder and the Bad Batch finds the facility. Infiltrating it, they find Benni and force him to take them to the ship. Benni, hoping to gain Mokko's favor, betrays the Bad Batch's presence. Just before they are captured, Omega discovers that Mokko has been exploiting his workers for his own profit. With this revelation, Benni turns his comrades against Mokko, who falls to his death. The Bad Batch fixes the Marauder and leaves the planet.</p><title>"Metamorphosis"</title><p>

Dr. Royce Hemlock assumes control of the Imperial cloning facility at Mount Tantiss, where Nala Se refuses to help with the Emperor's cloning projects. A covert transport bound for the facility is stranded and Cid assigns the Bad Batch to recover its cargo. While exploring the wreck, they discover that the cargo is an immature Zillo Beast that was created by the Empire through cloning. An Imperial strike force is sent to recover the beast and capture any witnesses, forcing the Bad Batch to retreat. In return for his freedom, Lama Su is brought to the Tantiss facility to persuade Nala Se to cooperate with Hemlock. Lama Su tells Hemlock that Nala Se cares for Omega.</p><title>"The Outpost"</title><p>

Crosshair is assigned to Lieutenant Nolan, who dislikes clones. At a remote Imperial outpost on Barton IV, two crates of classified cargo are stolen. Nolan orders Crosshair and clone commander Mayday to recover the cargo. The pair eliminate the thieves and find the cargo, which is Stormtrooper armor. An avalanche injures Mayday and buries the cargo. At the outpost, Nolan chastises them for their failure and refuses to provide a medic for Mayday, who succumbs to his injuries. Fed up with Nolan's arrogance and disrespect of clones, Crosshair kills him. After losing consciousness, Crosshair wakes up as a prisoner in the Tantiss facility and meets Dr. Emerie Karr.</p><title>"Pabu"</title><p>

After Cid did not come to rescue them from the mining planet, the Bad Batch and Omega informally cut ties with her. They help Phee recover a lost artifact, and she convinces them to accompany her to the peaceful island of Pabu which she thinks could be a safe place for them to live away from the Empire. They are hosted by Mayor Shep Hazard and his daughter Lyana, who befriends Omega. When a tsunami threatens the lower levels of the city, Hunter rescues Omega and Lyana from a boat while Tech and Wrecker help Shep and Phee evacuate the population of the lower levels. After the tsunami, the Bad Batch agrees to stay on Pabu and help rebuild.</p><title>"Tipping Point"</title><p>

Howzer and other clones imprisoned for disobedience against the Empire are rescued en route to Tantiss by Echo, Gregor, and other rogue clones. At Tantiss, Hemlock interrogates Crosshair about the whereabouts of Omega and the Bad Batch. Crosshair is left unattended for a moment and escapes long enough to send a message to the Bad Batch, warning them that the Empire is looking for Omega, before being subjected to intense torture. Echo joins the Bad Batch on Pabu with data he retrieved during the rescue. After receiving Crosshair's message and analyzing Echo's data, the Bad Batch learns about the Empire's secret Advanced Science Division (ASD).</p><title>"The Summit"</title><p>

The Bad Batch trails Hemlock to a summit, hosted by Tarkin on Eriadu, which concerns top-secret Imperial programs including the ASD's cloning research and "Project Stardust". As they sneak into the base where the summit is held, the Bad Batch discovers that Saw Gerrera has also infiltrated the compound to assassinate the assembled top-level Imperial officers. They ask Gerrera not to complete his mission so they can follow Hemlock back to the ASD's secret facility, but Gerrera sets off explosives when the intruders are discovered. The Bad Batch attempts to escape using the base's railcar system, but this is disrupted by the explosions and they are stranded.</p><title>"Plan 99"</title><p>

With their railcar stuck and under attack from Imperial forces, Tech sacrifices his life to boost the others away from the Empire. They retreat to Cid's parlor on Ord Mantell to treat their injuries and come to terms with their loss. They soon realize that Cid has betrayed them to Hemlock, who arrives and captures Hunter and Wrecker. This forces Omega to come into the open. Echo and AZI-3 rescue Hunter and Wrecker, but Omega is captured and taken to Tantiss. Hemlock uses Omega's presence to encourage Nala Se to work on their projects. Omega encounters Crosshair and Emerie Karr; the latter reveals herself to also be a clone, making her Omega's genetic sister.</p><title>"Confined"</title><p>

At the Tantiss facility, Omega is forced to work with Nala Se and Emerie on the cloning program. She takes daily blood samples from clones, including herself; Nala Se secretly discards the samples of Omega's blood before they can be used. Omega also feeds the facility's lurca hounds and befriends one of them, which she names Batcher. Omega evades the guards to speak with Crosshair, who attempts to discourage her from planning an escape. When the Imperials decide to euthanize Batcher for becoming too domesticated, Omega releases her into the jungle outside the facility. Hemlock warns Omega that further defiance will result in consequences for Crosshair.</p><title>"Paths Unknown"</title><p>

Hunter and Wrecker gain intel on Hemlock's base from the Durand crime family, but it leads them to an old abandoned facility. They run into former clone cadets Mox, Zeke, and Stak who were left behind when the Empire destroyed and abandoned the facility. The area is now covered in slither vines, an Imperial experiment gone awry. Zeke helps Hunter and Wrecker avoid the vines and enter the facility to access any data it has on Hemlock's operation. The trio are attacked by the slither vines, which are revealed to be the tentacles of a huge monster. Mox and Stak use the Marauder to rescue the others, and Hunter promises to take the cadets to Pabu.</p><title>"Shadows of Tantiss"</title><p>

Emperor Palpatine travels to Tantiss for an update on "Project Necromancer", which he believes is vital for the future of the Empire. It has so far failed to reproduce a subject's "M-count" in a clone. When Emerie begins testing a sample of Omega's blood, Nala Se urges Omega to escape. Omega frees Crosshair and they go into the jungle, searching for a recently crashed shuttle. Emerie alerts security and a search team are sent. Crosshair and Omega, joined by Batcher, steal the search team's shuttle. They are pursued by fighters, but Hemlock calls them off when Emerie realizes that they need Omega alive because her blood can be used to replicate an M-count.</p><title>"A Different Approach"</title><p>

With their shuttle damaged, Omega and Crosshair crash-land on the planet Lau. At a nearby spaceport, Crosshair wants to use force to hijack a ship but Omega insists on acquiring the money they need to bribe a clerk. While Omega uses her gambling skills to get the money, Batcher is taken by Imperial troops. Omega goes after her and Crosshair reluctantly follows. When they are cornered by Imperials, Omega agrees to let Crosshair use his skills to resolve the situation his way; they defeat the troops, free Batcher, and escape in a stolen freighter. The pair rendezvous with Hunter and Wrecker, who are overjoyed to see Omega but less happy to see Crosshair.</p><title>"The Return"</title><p>

Echo returns to Pabu, and the Bad Batch discusses the experiments being conducted at Tantiss. Omega has a datapad from the facility that could give them some answers, and Crosshair suggests they access it with an Imperial computer terminal at the outpost on Barton IV. Finding the base abandoned, they divert power from its defense perimeter so they can connect to the datapad. This allows a large creature to attack the base. Crosshair and Hunter distract the creature while the others turn the defense perimeter back on. The Bad Batch leaves the planet with information recovered from the datapad and Crosshair having earned the trust of his squad mates again.</p><title>"Infiltration"</title><p>

Guarded by Rex and his fellow rogue clones, former senator Singh meets with Senator Chuchi to discuss their efforts to oppose the Empire. They are attacked by a clone assassin, CX-1, who Rex captures. CX-1 carries a target register that includes Omega, so Rex summons the Bad Batch to his base on Teth. Omega and Crosshair reveal what they know about the ASD's experiments and the "Clone X" assassin program, which strips clones of their identities to make them perfect assassins. Another assassin, CX-2, is sent to kill the captured CX-1, which he does. CX-2 then sees Omega and calls for reinforcements, who are led by clone commander Wolffe.</p><title>"Extraction"</title><p>

The Bad Batch, Rex, and a few surviving rogue clones attempt to escape the base, pursued by Wolffe's men and CX-2. CX-2 shoots down the fugitive's escape shuttle, frustrating Wolffe because Omega is needed alive. The fugitives begin a rough trek to an extraction point where they plan to meet Echo and Gregor. CX-2 pursues them and fights Crosshair before falling over a waterfall, from which he later emerges alive. At the extraction point, Wolffe is surprised to see his old friend Rex is alive. Rex tells Wolffe what the Empire is doing to clones, and Wolffe lets them get away. Rex tells Hunter that they need to find out why Omega is so important to the Empire.</p><title>"Bad Territory"</title><p>

The Bad Batch asks Phee to investigate the Empire's M-count experiments, and she reports that bounty hunters have been hired to search for subjects with high M-counts. Believing Shand may know more about this, Hunter and Wrecker seek her out. Omega and Crosshair stay on Pabu and Omega tries to help Crosshair overcome a mental block that is affecting his sniper skills. Shand offers to provide Hunter and Wrecker with information if they help her capture her current target, Sylar Saris. After they have captured Saris, Shand says she will be in touch with the information. She then secretly informs another party about the Bad Batch and their questions.</p><title>"The Harbinger"</title><p>

Shand's contact, Asajj Ventress, comes to Pabu. She tells the Bad Batch that the M-count signifies a person's innate connection to the Force and starts testing Omega's ability using Jedi techniques. The Bad Batch is concerned when they realize Ventress was a Separatist assassin during the Clone Wars, but Omega trusts her. During their final test at sea, Ventress inadvertently summons a sea monster which attacks them. She pacifies the creature and rescues Omega, gaining the Bad Batch's trust. Ventress tells Omega that her M-count is low, but later indicates to the others that she was lying about this. She also warns them that they may not be safe on Pabu.</p><title>"Identity Crisis"</title><p>

Hemlock imprisons Nala Se, believing she helped Omega and Crosshair escape, and reluctantly promotes Emerie to be the new lead scientist of Project Necromancer. Emerie learns that the subjects being tested on are children with high M-counts that have been delivered to Tantiss by bounty hunters like Bane. She slowly becomes disillusioned with the Empire as she witnesses the cold and restrictive manner in which the children are being treated. Tarkin threatens to take away Hemlock's funding if the ASD does not produce the desired results. CX-2 reports to Hemlock that he is close to finding Omega after learning about her connection to Phee by torturing Cid.</p><title>"Point of No Return"</title><p>

CX-2 sneaks aboard Phee's ship and retrieves Pabu's location from its navigation computer. Concerned about the risk of staying on Pabu, the Bad Batch prepares to leave the planet when CX-2 arrives and confirms their presence. He destroys the Marauder, seriously injures Wrecker, and calls for reinforcements. With their means of escape cut off, the rest of the Bad Batch evade their pursuers while Hunter tries to steal an Imperial gunship. He is shot down by CX-2. Omega decides to surrender herself, to spare the people of Pabu and hoping the Bad Batch can follow her to Tantiss. However, Crosshair's attempt to plant a tracker fails as CX-2 leaves with Omega.</p><title>"Juggernaut"</title><p>

CX-2 returns Omega to Tantiss, where Emerie tests her blood and confirms that it is what they need. Hemlock takes Omega to be held with the other young Project Necromancer test subjects. Once the Imperial forces leave Pabu, Crosshair suggests to Hunter and Wrecker that they get the location for Tantiss from Rampart, who is imprisoned in an Imperial labor camp on Erebus. With Phee's help they infiltrate Erebus, hijack a prison transfer vehicle, and escape with Rampart. On Phee's ship, Rampart explains that no one knows Tantiss's coordinates but he is willing to help them find the facility in exchange for not being returned to the labor camp.</p><title>"Into the Breach"</title><p>

Omega is introduced to her fellow Project Necromancer test subjects: Eva, Jax, Sami, and Bayrn. She tells them that she has escaped from Tantiss before and plans to do so again using a passage behind their cell walls. The Bad Batch and Rampart rendezvous with Echo and a stolen Imperial shuttle, which they use to infiltrate an Imperial relay station at Coruscant to find the coordinates for Tantiss. Unable to extract the information from the station's databanks, Echo decides to sneak aboard a science shuttle bound for Tantiss and disable its proximity sensors. This allows the others to dock on the vessel in their stolen shuttle just as it enters hyperspace.</p><title>"Flash Strike"</title><p>

Hemlock is alerted that the Bad Batch infiltrated the relay station and sends fighters to intercept the incoming vessel. Hunter, Wrecker, Crosshair, and Rampart are forced to crash near Mount Tantiss and continue on foot, hunted by Stormtrooper patrols. With the base on high alert, Omega takes advantage of the distraction to scout her planned escape route and finds the Zillo Beast in an underground enclosure. In the jungle, Rampart accidentally awakens a large creature that attacks them, is separated from the others, and gets captured. Echo infiltrates the base and encounters Emerie, who tells him about the other children being held with Omega.</p><title>"The Cavalry Has Arrived"</title><p>

The children escape and free the Zillo Beast, which goes on a rampage through the facility, before finding Echo and Emerie. Hunter, Wrecker, and Crosshair infiltrate the base but are captured by Hemlock's CX operatives. Echo and Omega free Nala Se, Rampart, and the other clone prisoners while Emerie takes the other children to safety. Nala Se goes to destroy the facility's data, to protect Omega and prevent the Empire from using her research, but Rampart kills her and plans to use the research for leverage with the Empire.
